# 🔄 How to Switch Networks with Smart Accounts (Google Login)

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Smart Accounts Are Per-Network**

When you login with **Google/social** via Reown, it creates a **Smart Account** that's deployed on a **specific network**.

**You can't just "switch" networks** like with MetaMask.

## 🔧 **HOW TO USE YOUR SEPOLIA USDT**

### **Step 1: Open Reown Modal**
Click the network switcher button in the app (or your wallet button)

### **Step 2: Switch to Sepolia**
- Look for "Network" selector
- Choose **"Sepolia"**

### **Step 3: Disconnect Current Account**
- Click "Disconnect"
- This disconnects your BSC Smart Account

### **Step 4: Login with Google Again**
- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Choose "Google"
- Login again
- **New Smart Account created on Sepolia** ✅

### **Step 5: See Your 1,000 USDT**
- Balance will show: **1,000 USDT (Sepolia)**
- From transaction: `0x090722a...`

## 💡 **WHY THIS HAPPENS**

**Smart Accounts are deployed per-chain:**
- BSC Testnet Smart Account: Address `0xABC...` (deployed on BSC)
- Sepolia Smart Account: Address `0xDEF...` (deployed on Sepolia)
- **Different addresses on different chains**

**Regular wallets (MetaMask) use same address everywhere:**
- Can switch networks freely
- Same address on all chains
