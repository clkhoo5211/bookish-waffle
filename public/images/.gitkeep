## How to Use These Images:

Once you have the actual images:

1. Place them in this `/public/images/` directory
2. Update the components to use actual images instead of placeholders:
   - `app/page.tsx` - Update PhotoPlaceholder components with `<Image>` components
   - `components/merchant/MerchantCard.tsx` - Replace emoji with `<Image>` component
   - `app/tokens/page.tsx` - Replace Coffee/Store icons with merchant logos

Example code for replacing PhotoPlaceholder:

```tsx
// Instead of:
<PhotoPlaceholder type="thumbs-up-person" />

// Use:
<Image 
  src="/images/banner-thumbs-up.jpg" 
  alt="Business person giving thumbs up"
  width={320}
  height={140}
  className="object-cover"
/>
```
